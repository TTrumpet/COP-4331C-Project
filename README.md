# Code Cruiser
## Project Overview:
Our project is to code up a Code Racer. This game can be single-player or multiplayer, in which the player has to type the code that appears on the screen as quickly and accurately as possible. The code will generate more lines as the player types them, and the player can set how much time they will have to type beforehand. The number of words and/or lines will determine the scoring, landing them on the Leaderboard if their score is high enough. Each player has a custom name, profile, and “car” that can be seen speeding up or slowing down depending on how well the player performs during the gameplay. 
## Applicable Standards
- We will be using the standard style for the languages we are using. We will use Angular documentation and coding style for the frontend and Python PEP-8 coding style for the backend.
- The artifact size metric will be a single function representing an event within the event table.

## Software Life Cycle Process
We will be using a hybrid V-Model approach. Team members are working on different sections of the project, and each section will be unit-tested to ensure they work before being marked for completion.
## Tools and Computing Environment
We will use Windows operating system, Angular for the front end, and Python for the back end, with Flask database and pandas library. We will also use Git/GitHub for project management and version control.
## Configuration Management
We will handle version and change control by utilizing Git/GitHub.
## Quality Assurance
We will create unit testing instances for each activity. The responsibility falls onto the team member delegated for the activity to QA the material. The results will be reported using GitHub and Angular Documentation if necessary.
## Risk Management
1. Data Security Risk
    - Risk Type - Project Specific.
    - Risk Description - database leak impacting user privacy
    - Mitigation effort - Implement security measures.
    - Risk impact - Low. User privacy will not be heavily impacted.
2. Team Member Attrition Risk.
    - Risk Type - Generic Risk.
    - Risk Description - Potential loss of a team member.
    - Mitigation - An excess of slack time and clear communication. If unavoidable a revaluation of Time Estimates and Work packages.

## Technical Progress Metrics
We will be tracking our technical progress using functions. Every week, we will see what functions have been worked on and/or completed to ensure we are on track to completing our project.
## Plan for tracking, control, and reporting of progress
We will collect the number of functions we have completed each week and a percentage corresponding to how many more we need to complete our goal (completed/estimated total). We will also collect how much code was written to ensure we maintain speed.
